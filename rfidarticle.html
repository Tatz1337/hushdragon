      <h1><I>RFID COPYING</i></h1>
      <p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER LEAVE YOUR CARDS UNATTENDED</b></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Firstly, for science purposes, you can buy an RFID copier <a href="https://www.amazon.com/duplicator-English-Frequency-Programmer-13-56mhz/dp/B07BQRZH9W/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=usb+rfid+copier&qid=1559006287&s=electronics&sr=1-3">here.</a></h3>
    <p>RFID chips are basically tiny two-way radios that are so small they can fit inside a credit card, an article of clothing, the inside of a shampoo bottle cap, etc. The chip, essentially a transponder, carries identifying data and can be queried and read, or “sniffed,” at a distance. RFID technology is now in use in credit cards, ATM cards, “enhanced” driver’s licenses, highway toll networks, and inventory tracking systems.</p>
<p>The reason you’re starting to see RFID tags show up in credit and ATM cards is that the industry itself did some studies and found that people spend more when they actually don’t have to handle their credit card. The act of looking at your credit card, and the act of then having to get out a pen and sign for the purchase, creates many decision points at which a consumer could decide not to make the purchase.</p>

<strong><p>SOMEONE CAN COPY YOUR RFID DATA AND PUT IN ON ANOTHER CARD! VERY BAD FOR ID CARDS!</p></strong>
